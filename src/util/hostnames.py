"""
Service providing hostname resolution via reverse DNS lookups. This provides
both resolution via a thread pool (looking up several addresses at a time) and
caching of the results. If used, it's advisable that this service is stopped
when it's no longer needed. All calls are both non-blocking and thread safe.

Be aware that this relies on querying the system's DNS servers, possibly
leaking the requested addresses to third parties.
"""

# The only points of concern in terms of concurrent calls are the RESOLVER and
# RESOLVER.resolvedCache. This services provides (mostly) non-locking thread
# safety via the following invariants:
# - Resolver and cache instances are non-destructible
#     Nothing can be removed or invalidated. Rather, halting resolvers and
#     trimming the cache are done via reassignment (pointing the RESOLVER or
#     RESOLVER.resolvedCache to another copy).
# - Functions create and use local references to the resolver and its cache
#     This is for consistency (ie, all operations are done on the same resolver
#     or cache instance regardless of concurrent assignments). Usually it's
#     assigned to a local variable called 'resolverRef' or 'cacheRef'.
# - Locks aren't necessary, but used to help in the following cases:
#     - When assigning to the RESOLVER (to avoid orphaned instances with
#       running thread pools).
#     - When adding/removing from the cache (prevents workers from updating
#       an outdated cache reference).
