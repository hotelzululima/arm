arm (anonymizing relay monitor) - Terminal status monitor for Tor relays.

Description:
Command line application for monitoring Tor relays, providing real time status
information such as the current configuration, bandwidth usage, message log,
connections, etc. This uses a curses interface much like 'top' does for system
usage. The application is intended for command-line aficionados, ssh
connections, and anyone stuck with a tty terminal for checking their relay's
status. Releases should be stable so if you manage to make it crash (or have a
feature request) then please let me know!

The project was originally proposed in 2008 by Jacob and Karsten:
  http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Jan-2008/msg00005.html

An interview by Brenno Winter discussing the project is available at:
  http://www.atagar.com/arm/HFM_INT_0001.mp3

Requirements:
Python 2.5
TorCtl (this is included with arm)
Tor is running with an available control port. This means either...
  ... starting Tor with '--controlport <PORT>'
  ... or including 'ControlPort <PORT>' in your torrc

For full functionality this also needs:
- To be ran with the same user as tor to avoid permission issues with
  connection resolution and reading the torrc.

- Common *nix commands including:
    * ps
    * a method of connection resolution (any of the following):
      * sockstat
      * netstat
      * ss
      * lsof
      * procstat
    * tail
    * pwdx
    * ulimit
    * pgrep or pidof
    * host (if dns lookups are enabled)

This is started via 'arm' (use the '--help' argument for usage).

FAQ:
> Why is it called 'arm'?

Simple - because it makes the command short and memorable. Terminal
applications need to be easy to type (like 'top', 'ssh', etc), and anything
longer is just begging command-line aficionados to alias it down. I chose the
meaning of the acronym ('anonymizing relay monitor') afterward.

> If you're listing connections then what about exit nodes? Won't this include 
people's traffic?

No. Potential client and exit connections are specifically scrubbed of
identifying information. Be aware that it's highly discouraged for relay
operators to fetch this data, so please don't.

> Is it harmful to share the information provided by arm?

Not really, but it's discouraged. The original plan for arm included a special
emphasis that it wouldn't log any data. The reason is that if a large number of
relay operators published the details of their connections then correlation
attacks could break Tor user's anonymity. Just show some moderation in what you
share and it should be fine.

> Is there any chance that arm will leak data?

Not by default, arm is a passive listener with one exception. The second page
(connections) provides the hostnames of Tor relays you're connected to. This
means reverse DNS lookups which, if monitored, could leak your current
connections to an eavesdropper. However, this is disabled by default and
lookups are only made upon request (when showing connection details or listing
connections by hostname). See the page's help for how to enable lookups.

That said, this is not a terribly big whoop. ISPs and anyone sniffing your
connection already have this data - the only difference is that instead of
saying "I am talking to x" you're saying "I'm talking to x, who's x?", meaning
the resolver's also aware of who they are.

> When arm starts it gives "Unable to resolve tor pid, abandoning connection 
listing"... why?

If you're running multiple instances of tor then arm needs to figure out which
pid belongs to the open control port. If it's running as a different user (such
as being in a chroot jail) then it's probably failing due to permission issues.
Arm still runs, just no connection listing or ps stats.
