CHANGE LOG

2/14/10 - version 1.3.2

    * fix: bug with handing of DST for accounting's 'Time to reset' (patch provided by waltman)
    * fix: header and connection panels weren't accounting for having ORListenAddress set (caught by waltman)
    * fix: crashing bug when shrank too much for scrollbars to be drawn
    * fix: couple system commands weren't redirecting their stderr to /dev/null

2/7/10 - version 1.3.1 (r21580)
Had enough of a siesta - getting back into development beginning with a rewrite if the starter.

    * added: made authentication a little smarter, using PROTOCOLINFO to autodetect authentication type and cookie location
    * change: made 'blind mode' (disables connection queries) a startup option rather than flag in source (request by Sebastian)
    * change: all log events (including arm) are now set via character flags, with TorCtl events log as their own toggleable type
    * change: starting log label with runlevel events, condensing if logging a range
    * change: simplifying command line parsing via getopt
    * fix: blind mode now prevents all netstats (including connection counts and halting resolver thread), improving performance

    * fix: file descriptor dialog now provides a wider variety of error messages in case of failure
    * fix: offset issue in connections listing when scroll bar was visible
    * fix: removing family connections from listing when control port is closed
    * fix: preventing TorCtl startup issues from going to stdout (duplicates warnings)

Substantial bundle of changes including torrc validation, improved arm event logging, and numerous bug fixes.

    * added: verifies loaded torrc consistency against tor's actual state (gives warning and providing corrections)

    * fix: missing import for the socket module

7/20/09 - r20096, r20097, r20098
Couple fixes so arm plays nicely in the case of multiple running tor instances.

    * fix: can now deal with multiple tor instances: checks pid of process with the open control port
    * fix: if only one tor process is running use that pid (netstat fails if running as a different user

7/19/09 - r20087, r20090
Last substantial feature on my to-do list.

    * added: connections can be selected to view consensus details (very spiffy!)
    * added: listing selection is by menu rather than cycling

Miscellaneous fix and feature batch.

    * added: relay's flags to the header
    * added: listing by relay nickname

7/14/09 - r20016
Resolved a few quick bugs:

    * fix: added fingerprint lookup cache to resolve substantial performance issue
    * fix: hostname resolution progress accounts for newly added entries (no more negative progress)
    * fix: resolved bug that prevented arm from starting if too small
    * fix: ordering issue when sorting unresolved ip addresses

7/11/09 - r19975
Connections panel can now list by IP, hostname, or fingerprint: reverse resolution was easy, but comparing three different implementations and making it non-blocking with a pausable thread-pool backend? Not so much.

7/8/09 - r19953, r19957
Just got back from Toorcamp. Preliminary connection page and miscellaneous additions.

    * added: basic connection listing page (using netstat results)
    * added: connection listing now has user configurable sort functionality (it's actually pretty spiffy: supports secondary and tertiary sub-keys)
    * added: 'addfstr' to util which allows for embedded formatting tags (VERY helpful)
    * added: help shows page's current settings
    * added: made bandwidth panel toggleable
    * added: avg bandwidth to bottom of panel
    * fix: prevented header from being paused on page change

    * added: ps sampling (cpu/memory usage, pid, and uptime)
    * added: help popup with page controls
    * fix: corrected issue that caused periodic refreshing to fail
    * fix: accounting reset time takes into account DST

6/10/09 - r19708, r19709
Couple quick changes.

    * change: removed '--path-to-torctl' startup option
    * fix: accounting 'time to reset' now includes gmt to local conversion

6/7/09 - r19646, r19655, r19656
Couple features.

    * added: svn external inclusion of TorCtl
    * added: bandwidth panel now displays accounting data if set

6/6/09 - r19636, r19637
Quick change based on discussion on irc.

    * added: command line argument to specify location of TorCtl without changing Python path first (feature request by phobos)

6/5/09 - r19629
Substantial refactoring changes.

    * change: switched from a functional to an OO implementation which further simplified the controller: as an added plus this should make adding additional 'pages' trivial
    * change: offloaded resizing to the curses wrapper
    * fix: dealt with another curses wtf bug where panels wouldn't repaint unless done in a specific order

6/4/09 - r19626
Tested and corrected formatting for all event types except STREAM and STREAM_BW (not sure how to make those occur...).

6/2/09 - r19615, r19619, r19620
Introduced layer of abstraction from curses, simplifying its use and greatly improving reliability.

    * added: introduced wrapper to hide curses ugliness which greatly simplified interface code
    * added: notice when relay's been silent for five seconds (based on BW events so probably due to Tor being closed), another idea by karsten
    * changed: unchecked events have stubs to present information and provide debugging information in case of type mismatch
    * fix: all problems with resizing: it's now rock solid

5/29/09 - r19580, r19594
Fixes for several rather sinister reliability problems:

    * added: allows logged events to be changed while running (suggested feature by karsten) and experimenting with a more modular design
    * fix: added non-blocking reentrant locks to fix concurrency errors that caused chaotic terminal glitches (such as switching to a Chinese character set)
    * fix: now fully handles resizing (including vertical)
    * fix: using new capabilities in TorCtl including cookie authentication and disabling logging
    * fix: bandwidth graph bug when paused
    * fix: occasionally refreshes static content in case of graphical hiccups
    * fix: added workaround for obscure curses caching bug that prevented portions of the screen from being redrawn
    * fix: bug preventing initialization if too small

5/25/09 - r19567
Few small tweaks including:

    * added: tiny shell script to alias starting
    * added: more informative error message if TorCtl isn't available
    * change: defaultly logged events
    * change: make inclusion of 'unknown' events toggleable

5/24/09 - r19548, r19549, r19550, r19551
Initial version of arm (terminal relay status monitor). Repository set up by arma.

    * fix: bug concerning undefined exit policy
    * fix: resolved issue that prevented monitor from functioning in terminals without curs_set support
