Description: Terminal tor status monitor
 The anonymizing relay monitor (arm) is a terminal status monitor for Tor
 relays, intended for command-line aficionados, ssh connections, and anyone
 stuck with a tty terminal. This works much like top does for system usage,
 providing real time statistics for:
 .
 bandwidth, cpu, and memory usage
 .
 relay's current configuration
 .
 logged events
 .
 connection details (ip, hostname, fingerprint, and consensus data)
 .
 etc
 .
